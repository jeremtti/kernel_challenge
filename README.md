The start.py file contains all the code we used for the final submissions, that is : mismatch kernel computation and combinaison of kernels.
In the notebook we added the code of the rest of the trials we made, including the dynamic programming computation of the substring kernel, the spectrum kernel and the SVM algorithm.
